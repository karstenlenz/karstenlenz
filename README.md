# Hi, I'm Karsten!

## I'm a senior web developer & UX designer from Hamburg, Germany.

After working in UX design for many years, I have jumped head-first into web development a while ago. Now I am transforming user-centric designs into clean frontend code.

### Showcase: "Youlity - Discover Your Personality"
 
This is progressive web app I designed and developed, that enables you to gain new insights into your personality based on a state of the art therapeutic questionnaire. I partnered up with a professional therapist to get the science right and created a smooth, mobile-first user experience.
You can check it out [here.](https://github.com/karstenlenz/capstone-project)  (In German only at this point.)
