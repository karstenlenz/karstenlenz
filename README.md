# Hi, I'm Karsten!

## I'm a junior web developer & senior UX designer from Hamburg, Germany.

After working in UX design for many years, I started my journey to become a web developer this year. I hope to create many beautiful web apps in the future with great UX.

After completing a web development bootcamp at neuefische, I finished my capstone project ("Digitales Gesellenst√ºck"):

 "Youlity - Discover Your Personality".
 
  It's progressive web app that enables you to gain new insights into your personality based on the  state of the art therapeutic questionnaire. I partnered up with a professional therapist to get the science right. 
You can check it out [here.](https://github.com/karstenlenz/capstone-project)  (In German only at this point.)
